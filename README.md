## Projects

### Web Application Project - León Bicicletas

As part of my learning journey, completed a web application project that showcases my skills in building interactive and responsive web applications. This project was developed using a combination of HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript and PHP. It's a website made for a small business and part of a school project. It has a catalog, a quotation tool similar to a shopping cart and CRUD System for administration.

You can check out the project [here](http://leonbicicletas.rf.gd/es/).
